###  about redux
* facebook initially build / use react
* they talk about flux archi, architecture based, to maintain state, on one way direction as opposed to have 2 have ways
* a lot of flux implementation
* dan a has written redux
* 2 kbytes min, a finished product today

as a user, you write a lot of js: when you write a reducer is a plain function with is no external dependancies

Reasons for any interest in redux

* the difference with the existing solution use in angularjs


###  about npm
if we would have started from scratch, you end end with a package json file

```
npm init
```

```
npm run lint
```


```
npm run cmd_of_script
```

by default

```
npm start
```

```
npm test
```

Avoid to have global dependancies


### about webpack

extremely powerful but the configuration is chalenging 
* run in live mode
* run a build script
